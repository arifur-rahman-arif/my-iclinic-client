Â£350 is not an amount that you can excluded a cup of cheap coffee. Customers shouldnâ€™t be treated like this. Dr Odufuwa picked up a disorder in my eyes and recommended surgery. I was about to go to my home country and visited an eye hospital there and the second doctor confirmed Dr Odufuwaâ€™s finding. My operation done there and then. I am thankful to doctor Odufuwa.
