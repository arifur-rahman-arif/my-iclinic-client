        After noticing that my distance vision when driving was becoming uncomfortable and driving at night was becoming more and more difficult and new prescription glasses didn’t make much difference I decided to have cataract surgery. A friend recommended I have a consultation at the I-Clinic. Their professional examination was really Impressive and I had my totally painless operation to remove the cataracts (on both eyes) completed within the next four weeks.`,
