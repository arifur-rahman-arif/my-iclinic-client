                understand wearing glasses instead of contact lenses is difficult but this temporary step will
                make your ReLEX SMILE treatment possible and give you the best visual freedom you need to
                permanently get rid of contact lenses or glasses for your future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hard contact lens wearers can temporarily use soft contact lenses if they need to remove their
                lenses for more than 2 weeks. If you only need to remove your hard contact lenses for 2 weeks,
                we advise to temporarily wear glasses until your measurements are taken / before your
                treatment.

        title: 'Why do I need to remove my contact lenses before my laser consultation and before my treatment day?',
        description: `We understand it can be difficult removing your contact lenses but as contact lenses distort the
        shape of your natural eye, it is best recommended to remove any contact lenses 2 weeks before
        your laser consultation, ready for your eye assessments. This will make sure any measurements
        taken from your eyes are perfectly measured to assess your suitability. For your treatment day
        our visumax laser can correct your vision precisely, providing your contact lenses are removed 2
        weeks before your procedure day. Our laser specialist will clearly talk you through any
        requirements before your treatment and help you with any concerns you have about removing
        your contact lenses.`

        title: 'How long does ReLEx SMILE surgery take to heal?',
        description: `Usually RelEX SMILE heals within 3 days after the procedure however we leave one week for
        recovery before your aftercare appointment with your laser specialist. We will then ask you to
        attend two more follow up appointments (6 months and 12 months) in the future to monitor how
        you are with your new, natural vision. We like our patients to feel that their aftercare is
        important because it is. This is why our specialists will check in with you up to 12 months after
        your treatment.

        description: `Our Relex smile surgery is not painful or uncomfortable during the treatment because we use
        anesthetic eye drops before the laser corrects your vision. Some patients describe an itchy
        sensation after their treatment but this lasts only a few hours.
