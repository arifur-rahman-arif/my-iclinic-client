            'Presbyopia is a refractive error in your eye which stops you from seeing objects up close (age related far-sightendness/ long sightedness). For example, you may find that reading, texting or seeing things clearly without bright light to be quite difficult.'

        title: 'What causes Presbyopia?',
        description:
            'Presbyopia is an age related condition which stiffens the muscles controlling the movement and focus of your eyes. Usually glasses are needed to compensate for seeing up close unless you  wish to be free from changing your glasses which is why we offer Presbyond laser treatment.'

        title: 'What is Presbyond Laser Treatment?',
        description: `Our Presbyond laser treatment is designed for people suffering from Presbyopia (also known as
            farsightedness, long-sightedness, hypermetropia or hyperopia) which is an age-related condition
            that requires you to depend on reading glasses. Over time you may experience that your natural
            lens inside the eye deteriorates which makes near focusing increasingly difficult after the age of
            40 and can start interfering with day to day tasks.

        title: 'How does Presbyond work?',
        description: `Our Presbyond treatment is a sophisticated wavefront laser which significantly reduces and/or
        eliminates the need for any reading glasses in the future. To achieve clarity in all areas of your
        sight ( near, intermediate and distance) our presbyond will re-shape and correct your cornea to
        create ‘blended vision’. This blended vision allows you to eventually see at all distances without
        the need for reading glasses.`

        title: 'What does ‘blended vision’ mean?',
        description: `Presbyond ‘blended vision’ is a term used to describe the way in which your eyes can see from
        all distances (near, intermediate and into the distance). Presbyond treatment has the highest
        chance of achieving clear vision at all distances because of its unique blend zone technology,
        designed to be the most successfully modern procedure for anyone suffering from presbyopia.

        title: 'How do I know if I am suitable for Presbyond?',
        description: `Presbyond is a treatment for a condition called presbyopia (age related farsightedness). When
        you get older you may experience changes in your vision and you may not realize that you have
        presbyopia. The best way to understand if you are experiencing presbyopia is to ask yourself a
        few questions:
        <ul class="mt-12 grid gap-8 list-disc pl-12">
            <li class="list-item list-disc"><p>Do I experience blurry vision without your reading glasses on?</p></li>

        title: 'How successful is Presbyond laser eye surgery?',
        description: `Our Presbyond laser treatment procedure works in 97% of patients who immediately see the
        improvement in their vision. In very rare cases, and depending on the condition of your eyes,
        Presbyond may cause a ‘cross-blur’. Cross-blur occurs when your brain is trying to adjust to the
        new correction in each eye. If you experience cross-blur we can temporarily correct this with
        glasses until your eyes adjust or we can simply correct your refraction again to make sure you
        are free from glasses.`

        weeks to as long as a year depending on your eyes. Our laser specialist will continuously
        monitor the progression of your vision and your independence from glasses. 97% of our patients
        immediately see the improvement and clarity after having their Presbyond treatment.`

        description: `Presbyond is an innovative laser technology which achieves a far greater success rate than any
        comparable treatment such as: monovision. Presbond is designed to extend your vision's depth
        of focus and reduce the symptoms you may experience with conventional monovision treatment
        (halos, glares, starbursts). In comparison, Monovision is successful for 65% of patients whereas
        Presbyond is successful for 97% of patients. This is why Presbyond is considered the most
        advanced laser treatment for people over the age of 40.`

                Yes, you may be very suitable for Presbyond if you are suffering from cataracts. It is best to wait
                at least 3 to 6 months after having your cataract surgery before proceeding with Presbyond

                Having Presbyond surgery in no way affects cataract surgery so after we remove your cataracts
                and complete presbyond treatment, your vision should return to normal, and you should remain
                independent of glasses.

                At a private consultation with our Presbyond specialist, we will carry out detailed eye

                Treatment.

        title: 'Is Presbyond the same as multifocal implants surgery?',
        description: `No, Presbyond is different from having multifocal implants. With our Presbyond laser treatment,
        your natural lens is not operated on and the procedure is carried out by one laser shaping the
        surface of your cornea. Due to this our Presbyond surgery is minimally invasive and will not
        require any insertion inside of your eye. However with Multifoclas, our specialists need to insert
        an implant into the eyes in order to achieve better vision. If you are suitable for Presbyond and
        Monovision, and depending on the health of your eyes and the lifestyle you have, we would
        advise Presbyond as the best treatment option for you. If you are undecided between Presbyond
        and other laser treatments we offer, please feel free to contact us on 0208 445 8877 to get a
        suitability check and/or private consultation with our laser specialist.`

        description: `Multifocal implants are used to replace the natural lens either as part of a cataract operation, or
        when a patient chooses to have their clear lens replaced to be free of glasses. They can provide
        a solution for some patients, but they can cause disturbances in vision, which can be
        troublesome. These disturbances include halos around lights, starbursts and glare. Sometimes
        the patient with a multifocal implant has difficulty driving at night due to these disturbances.
        These disturbances are almost non-existent with our Presbyond surgery.`

        With Presbyond surgery, there can be a chance that you experience ‘cross-blur’, which is when
        your brain takes longer to process the correction of your eyes in order to see clearly at all
        distances. Cross-blur is a temporary symptom and our specialists will prescribe a temporary pair
        of short-term glasses to help you through your adaptation period.
