                Hard contact lens wearers can temporarily use soft contact lenses if they need to remove their

                we advise to temporarily wear glasses until your measurements are taken / before your
                treatment.

            Prices vary between your

            Occasionally it is necessary to
            charge extra if a patient has a

            cataract. Such extra charges
            would be discussed before
            the surgery takes place. It
