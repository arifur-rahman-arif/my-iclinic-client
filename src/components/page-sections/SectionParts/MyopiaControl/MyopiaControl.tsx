                progressing.

                better changed for the benefit of your child's eye health.

                Your child's Myopia specialists will need to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and the health of
                your child's eye. Because Myopia is a chronic condition, it needs to be monitored carefully to prevent
                the eye from growing.

                Most people think Myopia is a curable eye condition once they have their Atropine eye drops, but in some
                cases your childâ€™s eyes may start rapidly growing too long (also known as Hyperopia) or the
                concentration of their treatment may need to change.

                A myopia check-up appointment is very important especially after your child has been given a course of

                child's quality of life and vision much better.
